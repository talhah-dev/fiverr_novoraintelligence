This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Core Pages (Must-have) — 6 pages

/ Home

/how-we-work

/security

/roi

/pilot

/contact (or /connect)

Problem Pages (Modular Objection Pages) — start with 3–6

Create a folder like:

/problems/manual-work

/problems/disconnected-systems

/problems/compliance-risk

/problems/data-access

/problems/slow-ops

/problems/no-auditability

These are shareable landing pages for ads + objections.

So total:

6 core pages

+ 3 to 6 objection pages at launch


=========

✅ Pages completed (MVP-level)

Home (hero + sections + navbar + footer + shared CTA)

/security (hero + boundaries + governance + architecture + shared CTA)

/pilot (hero + deliverables + weekly breakdown + requirements + shared CTA)

/roi (hero + before/after + calculator + measurement + shared CTA)

/how-we-work (hero + steps + tools + shared CTA)

❗ Pages still left (recommended to finish)

/trusted-systems (credibility page: n8n + AWS + GCP + “transferable expertise bridge”)

/problems (or “use-cases”) page (each objection/problem gets its own section/page like client said)

/contact page (even if CTA is shared, you still need a full page route)

/privacy and /terms (footer links — basic placeholder pages at least)
